Title: Parsimonious models for epidemic curves under heterogenous individual reproduction

Description: Superspreading is a feature of many epidemics. 
    This phenomenon is a consequence of heterogenous disease reproduction.
    This package provides tools for estimating the cohort reproduction number, that is,
    the expected number of secondary infections for each index case within a cohort of
    individuals infected at a particular time, and assessing epidemic curves for evidence 
    of superspreading.
